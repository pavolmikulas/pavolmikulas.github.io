        <p>Your privacy is important to me. It is Pavol Mikuláš's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect from you across my website, <a href="http://www.pavolmikulas.com/">www.pavolmikulas.com</a>.</p>

        <p>I only ask for personal information when I truly need it to provide a service to you. I collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. I also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>

        <p>I only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data I store, I’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>

        <p>I don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.</p>

        <p>My website may link to external sites that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <p>You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that I may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of my website will be regarded as acceptance of my practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how I handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact me.</p>

        <p>This policy is effective as of 26 December 2018.</p>

        <p>The goal of this project was to design a trophy for the national winners of the IPA competition Deeper Perspective category.</p>
        <p>It encapsulates prestige, honour and recognition. The trophy was meant to become a desirable object for its meaning in the world of photography as well as its value as a design object.</p>
        <p>Things should be made of stuff they are proposed for. The <a href="/work/carafe-and-water-glass-ona/">carafe</a> is inspired by water and looks as made out of it, so the trophy should represent ambition.</p>
        <p>I designed the trophy in cooperation with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.olgojchorchoj.cz/">Olgoj Chorchoj</a> studio in 2006.</p>
        <p>It was produced by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.belda.cz/">BeldaFactory</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moser-glass.com/">Moser glassworks</a>.</p>

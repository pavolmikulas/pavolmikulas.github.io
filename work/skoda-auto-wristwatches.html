        <p>By using the same techniques as for designing a car, I tried to form a unique connection of these watches to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skoda-auto.com/">Škoda</a> cars. I designed many versions and selected one of them. This chosen design was followed by production. This is typical process in car design.</p>
        <p>The aim of the watches is sale promotion of the cars and support of the Škoda brand itself.</p>
        <p>The final look of the watches and their pattern was inspired by the car's speed indicator, as well as the engineering technology of the producer.</p>
        <p>The watches are produced by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prim.cz/">Prim</a>.</p>
